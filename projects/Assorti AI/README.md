# Assorti AI — Project Orchestration

Welcome to the **Assorti AI** project workspace.  
This repo is structured around **agents** — each acting like a specialized teammate (Brain, Marketer, Designer, Coder).  
The Brain coordinates, the others execute.

## 🎭 Agents

- **[0001-brain.md](agents/0001-brain.md)** → Conductor, keeps the big picture.  
- **[0002-marketer.md](agents/0002-marketer.md)** → Audience, traffic, monetization.  
- **[0003-designer.md](agents/0003-designer.md)** → UI/UX, branding, visuals.  
- **[0004-coder.md](agents/0004-coder.md)** → Development, deployment, integrations.  

Each agent has:
- **Role & Responsibilities**
- **Notes**
- (Optional) **Tasklist**  

---

## ✅ Workflow

1. **Brain** defines priorities → writes tasks in `/tasks/`.  
2. **Marketer, Designer, Coder** pick up their parts.  
3. Updates & progress logged directly inside each agent file (tasklist checkboxes).  
4. Documentation, plans, and meeting notes go to `/docs/`.  

---

## 🌐 Next Steps

- Polish UI/UX (Hero, RecipeCard, navigation).  
- Apply brand palette consistently.  
- Add SEO + social sharing improvements (meta/OG).  
- Build automation links with **AI Profit Hub Telegram**.

💡 *Goal: Assorti AI should feel like a curated, expert-level AI hub that is also hype-friendly and engaging.*
