## Decision Log (append as you go)

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact | Owner |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|

## Risks & Assumptions
- **RISK**: weak design → low trust. **Mitigation**: polish Hero + OG kit first.  
- **RISK**: content inconsistency. **Mitigation**: recipe template + review checklist.  
- **ASSUMPTION**: Telegram can drive initial traffic. Validate in 2 weeks.
