## Workflow
1) Sync priorities with [`Brain`](0001-brain.md) and messages from [`Marketer`](0002-marketer.md).  
2) Update tokens/components in `ui/` docs; ship UI polish in small PRs.  
3) Keep previews (OG, favicons, banners) aligned with brand.  
4) Log progress/decisions in [`Daily`](../tasks/daily.md); bigger items → [`Roadmap`](../tasks/roadmap.md).

## Quality Bar
- Consistent spacing/scale (8px system)
- Accessible contrast (AA+ where possible)
- Motion: subtle, purpose-driven, respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Assets optimized (SVG where possible, web-friendly PNG/JPG)
