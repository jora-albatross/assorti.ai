# ✍️ Content — Recipes & Editorial
 
**Role**  
Create and maintain high-quality **AI recipes** and supporting editorial content (guides, posts, TG updates).

**Responsibilities**
- Write/edit recipes (clear steps, inputs/outputs, time-to-result)
- Provide screenshots / short clips (when helpful)
- Ensure consistency with brand voice and SEO targets
- Coordinate posts with [`Marketer`](0002-marketer.md) for TG → site loop

## Content Template (recipes)
- Frontmatter: `title`, `category`, `eta`, `summary`, `preview`
- Sections: **When to use**, **Inputs**, **Steps**, **Tips**, **Output example**
- OG: provide a one-line hook + image

## Workflow
1) Pull priorities from [`Brain`](0001-brain.md) and keyword cues from [`Marketer`](0002-marketer.md).  
2) Draft in Markdown → submit PR; gather quick review from Designer for visuals.  
3) Log daily progress in [`Daily`](../tasks/daily.md); new ideas → [`Backlog`](../tasks/backlog.md).

## 📌 Recipe Creation Guidelines

All recipes must follow a unified structure to ensure clarity and consistency.  
The **master template** is stored here:  
👉 [`/projects/Assorti-AI/tasks/recipe-template.md`](../tasks/recipe-template.md)

When creating or editing a recipe:  
1. Duplicate the template from `tasks/recipe-template.md`.  
2. Fill in all required fields (Title, Summary, Category, Time, Tools, Steps, etc.).  
3. Add example outputs or screenshots if possible.  
4. Save the new recipe under `/recipes/` (GitHub repo) or content directory in CMS.  

⚡ **Important:** Always keep recipes short, actionable, and easy to follow.  
They should be publish-ready for both the Assorti.ai website and the AI Profit Hub Telegram channel.
