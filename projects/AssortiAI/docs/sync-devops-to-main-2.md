   - Include Node.js + Astro runtime image.  

2. **Integrate Docker build into CI**
   - Add a new workflow `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` for image testing.  
   - Test container build + cache optimization.  

3. **Automation Foundation**
   - Prepare GitHub Action for automated build and artifact validation.
